usage
=====

main.py:

Note that currently this is rough code and as such you have to modify some code constats to change settings.

All configureation is in main.py toward the top.  These variables are clearly labeled.  Currently the only adjustable things are the serial port used and the OD setpoint.

To run, make sure the correct serial port is setup and execute main.py (eg in a terminal, type 'python main.py' without the single quotes).



plot.py:

Used to quickely plot data generated by main.py.  Assuming numpy/scipy are installed, just run 'python plot.py'.
